# Bayesian Optimization From Scratch in Julia Programming Language

This project was done under the supervision of Dr Sourish Das at CMI. During this offline project, I learned about Bayesian Data Analysis and implemented various sampling algorithms in Julia. I then learned about Gaussian processes and their use in Bayesian Optimization. I implemented Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process with squared exponential kernel and different aquisition functions. Also, an example of the same but with error included is also in the code.
